# Analysis-of-Agricultural-Productivity-and-Trade-in-West-Africa.
This project evaluates West Africa's agricultural productivity and its impact on trade patterns from 2014 to 2022.

Ø  WHY THIS PROJECT?

Agriculture plays a crucial role in African economies. Between 2014 to 2022, Sierra Leone registered the agricultural sector's highest contribution to GDP in Africa, at over 60 percent. This highlights the significant potential of West African agriculture. Despite the sector's importance, the relationship between agricultural productivity and trade patterns in West Africa remains underexplored. This project aims to fill that gap by evaluating agricultural productivity in West Africa and its impact on trade from 2014 to 2022. The findings are expected to contribute to strategies for enhancing food security, optimizing trade relationships, and fostering sustainable economic development in the region.

Ø  OVERALL OBJECTIVE:  Analyze West Africa's agricultural productivity and its impact on trade patterns from 2014 to 2022.

Specific Objective SO1: Identify the product categories with the highest gross production in USD in West Africa.
Specific Objective SO2: Determine and compare trade balances (in tons) for key agricultural products.
Specific Objective SO3: Examine whether these products' negative trade balance is due to gross production

Ø  METHODS

Data collection

This project utilizes data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations' statistical database, FAOSTAT [2]. We extracted the following key variables for Western African countries: Gross Production Value (in current thousand US dollars), Import Quantity (in tons), and Export Quantity (in tons) for agricultural products.

Our analysis focuses on the period of 2014 to 2022, and the selected variables allow us to assess: Agricultural output through Gross Production Value, Trade flows via Import and Export Quantities, and Trade balances by comparing import and export data. Table 1 below summarizes the key variables used in this study.
